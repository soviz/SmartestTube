/**
 * Phone playback host for the stmobile flavor.
 *
 * Reuses the shared {@link PlaybackActivity} (the whole player — engine, controls, PIP —
 * is kept intact) and adds the phone behaviors: screen orientation by video type (Shorts lock
 * portrait, regular videos rotate freely for the upright strip layout) and touch-friendly
 * overlay handling (a tap on the faded player only reveals the controls — see
 * {@link MobilePlaybackFragment#interceptPlayerTouch}).
 *
 * Known limitation: orientation is decided when the activity is created / re-entered, so a
 * single player session that crosses a Short/regular-video boundary (e.g. autoplay) keeps
 * the first video's orientation until the activity is recreated.

     * - PIP (either already in PIP, or the user picked {@code BACKGROUND_MODE_PIP}) — Back should
     *   enter/keep PIP, an explicit opt-in feature, not be hijacked into a stop.
     * - Home / lock-screen background audio — that runs through onUserLeaveHint/onStop, a different

     * deliberately no-ops while the engine is blocked). But closing the PIP window does NOT finish
     * this activity: the overridden {@link PlaybackActivity#finish()} treats a blocked engine as
     * "keep playing", so the activity just parks in the stopped state ({@code onStop} runs with
     * {@code isFinishing() == false} and no {@code onDestroy}) and the blocked engine keeps
     * playing audio behind the now-closed window.
     *
     * The reliable discriminator (verified on device) is the lifecycle state when PIP mode ends:
     * dismissing the window delivers {@code onPictureInPictureModeChanged(false)} while the activity
     * is only CREATED (stopped, not returning to the foreground); expanding PIP back to fullscreen
     * delivers it at STARTED/RESUMED. So on the dismiss case we unblock the engine and finish for
     * real ({@link #finishReally()} releases the now-unblocked player and tears the activity down).
